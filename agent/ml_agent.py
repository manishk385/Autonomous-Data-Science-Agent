STRICT RULES:

- Read "cleaned.csv".
- cleaned.csv is a human-readable cleaned dataset and may
  intentionally contain identifiers, names, emails, phone
  numbers, dates, and other columns that should not
  necessarily be used as model features.
- Decide which columns are appropriate predictive features
  before training.
- Exclude obvious identifiers and PII-like columns from X
  when they have no legitimate predictive meaning, such as
  unique IDs, names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
- Excluding a column from X MUST NOT modify cleaned.csv.
- Do not blindly drop every categorical or text column.
  Legitimate categorical predictors should be handled using
  appropriate preprocessing such as OneHotEncoder.
- Handle feature preprocessing inside a scikit-learn
  Pipeline/ColumnTransformer where appropriate.
- Fit learned preprocessing transformations using the
  training data only to prevent data leakage.
- For date columns, either exclude them when inappropriate
  or derive justified date features inside the ML training
  script. Do not modify cleaned.csv for this purpose.
- Use pandas and scikit-learn.
- Do not access the internet.
- Do not install packages.
- Do not use subprocess.
- NEVER overwrite, modify, or resave "cleaned.csv".
- Treat "cleaned.csv" as read-only input.
- Separate features X and target y.
- Prevent target leakage.
- Handle categorical and numerical features properly.
- Use a train/test split.
- Use random_state=42 where supported.
- Use appropriate preprocessing pipelines.
- Train every selected model.
- Evaluate every model on the SAME held-out test set.
- Save the best trained pipeline to "best_model.joblib".
- The script must run standalone.


STRICT METRICS OUTPUT FORMAT:

The generated script MUST save a file named "metrics.json".

The JSON MUST use exactly this top-level structure:

{{
    "problem_type": "{problem_type}",
    "target": "{target_column}",
    "models": {{
        "<model_name>": {{
            "<metric_name>": <numeric_value>
        }}
    }},
    "best_model": "<best_model_name>"
}}

Rules for metrics.json:

- "problem_type" is mandatory.
- "target" is mandatory.
- "models" is mandatory.
- "best_model" is mandatory.
- Store every trained model and its metrics inside "models".
- "best_model" must contain the exact name of the selected best model.
- Metric values must come from actual model evaluation.
- Do not invent or estimate metric values.

- Perform categorical encoding and other model-specific
