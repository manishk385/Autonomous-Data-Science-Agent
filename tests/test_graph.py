"""
tests/test_graph.py — LangGraph Pipeline Integration Test

Directly invokes `run_autonomous_cleaning` (the LangGraph entry point)
without going through the HTTP layer.  Tests that the complete two-stage
pipeline (data cleaning → ML training) executes successfully end-to-end
and returns a well-formed result dict.

This test makes real LLM calls and runs generated code in a subprocess,
so it is an integration test and may take a minute or more to complete.
